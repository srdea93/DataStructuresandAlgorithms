Anatomy of a Recursive Function:
2 Paths:
    1) Recursive case - the case where the function gets called again
        return <function call ()>
    2) Base case - stop calling the function, nothing left to do
        return <base case value>

Steps:
    1) identify base case
    2) idenfity recursive case
    3) get closer and closer and return when needed - usually have 2 returns (1 for base case and 1 for recursive case)

When to use Recursion?
    1) Everytime we are using a tree or converting something into a tree
        a) Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem
        b) Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature
        c) the solutions of the subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand
    2) Divide and conquer
